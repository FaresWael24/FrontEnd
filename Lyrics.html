    [Intro]
    Mona Lisa, ayy
    Mona Lisa
    
    [Chorus]
    Love is when you try to place it out your mind
    But you can't turn a radio down
    And you can't think of anyone else
    And love is when you try to make it out alive
    But you can't turn a radio down
    And you can't think of anyone else
    
    [Verse 1]
    Uh-huh, look, I can see your face in the Parisian paintings
    The Mona Lisa
    I can hear your voice in the streets and the TV stations
    And the police's
    I can feel the strings on my wrist, I don't need these bracelets
    Of all the things that she keeps in cages
    Uh-huh, I'm her leastest favorite
    Uh-huh, and she said
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    "I was 'bout to give you all of me on all the weekends
    And all I wanted was apologies and all of your bed," uh
    Over my heels and fallin' on my head
    But all of my feels were already dead
    And if I could rewind it for you
    If you could remind me of
    What I felt before I fell for your idea of love out here
    
    [Chorus]
    Love is when you try to place it out your mind (Uh-huh)
    But you can't turn a radio down (Uh-huh)
    And you can't think of anyone else (Uh-huh, uh)
    And love is when you try to make it out alive (Uh-huh)
    But you can't turn a radio down (Uh-huh)
    And you can't think of anyone else (Uh-huh, uh)
    
    [Post-Chorus]
    Uh, Mona Lisa, oh
    Yeah, the Mona Lisa, ayy
    With the Mona Lisa, uh, yeah
    Yeah, Mona Lisa, oh
    Mona Li—, uh-uh
    Uh, Mona Lisa, oh, yeah
    
    [Verse 2]
    I know you like your space and distance (Oh)
    Yeah, you don't take admissions (Oh)
    They told you not to date musicians (Oh)
    Yeah, but can't make you listen
    Stick to the ones who let you make (All the)
    All the decisions and look the other way (All the)
    And you already know what your mother'll say (All the)
    And you already know I'm a number away
    
    
    [Pre-Chorus]
    "I was 'bout to give you all of me on all the weekends
    And all I wanted was apologies and all of your bed," uh
    Over my heels and fallin' on my head
    But all of my feels were already dead
    And if I could rewind it for you
    If you could remind me of
    What I felt before I fell for your idea of love out here
    
    [Chorus]
    Love is when you try to place it out your mind (Uh-huh)
    But you can't turn a radio down (Uh-huh)
    And you can't think of anyone else (Uh-huh, uh)
    And love is when you try to make it out alive (Uh-huh)
    But you can't turn a radio down (Uh-huh)
    And you can't think of anyone else (Uh-huh, uh)
    
    [Post-Chorus]
    Uh, Mona Lisa, oh
    Yeah, the Mona Lisa, ayy
    With the Mona Lisa, uh, yeah
    Yeah, Mona Lisa, oh
    Mona Li—, uh-uh
    Uh, Mona Lisa, oh, yeah
    
    [Outro]
    Duh-duh-duh, duh, hey
    Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
    Duh-duh-duh, duh
